The old version of the changed record is updated to reset its validity date and its status. This allows all historical information to be accurately preserved.\n\n(Check in #1)\nRequired fields in the slowly changing dimension:\n1. Surrogate key - numeric field of integer or bigint data type\n2. Set of fields (or a single field) that represents the unique record identifier or the primary key of the source object\n3. VALID_FROM - must have exact same name. Represents the record validity start datetime. The starting value is 1900/01/01\n4. VALID_TO - must have exact same name. Represents the record validity end datetime. For the most current record, the value is set to 2099/12/31\n5. CURRENT_FLAG - must have exact same name. Represents the record status.  Y if this is the most recent version; N - historical version\n6. CRC_NUM - must have exact same name. Cyclic Redundancy Check number used to detect the changes\n\nNOTE: Multiple instances of the target connection and the target object are necessary to implement different target field map rules:\n• insert a new record\n• insert a new version of the existing record\n• update the outdated record status and validity date",
